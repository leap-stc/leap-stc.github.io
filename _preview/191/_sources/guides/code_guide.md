## Working with git

The recommended way to move code in and out of the hub is via github. This will version control your code via git and serve as one backup location for your research code. The recommended way to authenticate is to use [gh-scoped-creds](https://docs.2i2c.org/user/topics/data/git/#using-gh-scoped-creds) which is preinstalled on the default software images.
Please read the in-depth [guide by 2i2c](https://docs.2i2c.org/user/topics/data/git/#move-code-in-and-out-of-the-hub-with-github) for more details.
