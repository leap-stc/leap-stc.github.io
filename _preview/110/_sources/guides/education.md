### How to sign up students

Students should be signed up to the appropriate user [categories](users.categories) ahead of the class. Please direct your students to this documentation and try to ensure that everyone has [access to the Hub](hub:server:login) before the class starts.

#### Troubleshooting

**Students cannot sign on**

Check if the students are part of the [appropriate github teams](users:categories). 

If they **are not** follow these steps:
- [ ] Did the student [sign up for LEAP membership]()?
- [ ] Did the student receive a github invite? [Here](users.invite) is how to check for that.  
- [ ] Check again if they are part of the [appropriate github teams](users:categories).
- If these steps do not work, please reach out to [](contact.data_compute_manager).

If they **are**, ask them to try the following steps:
- [ ] Refresh the browser cache
- [ ] Try a different browser
- [ ] Restart the computer
- If these steps do not work, please reach out to [](contact.data_compute_manager).
