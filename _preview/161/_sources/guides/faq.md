## I cannot log into the hub ðŸ˜±

If you are unable to log into the hub, please check the following steps:

- \[ \] Check if you are member of the [appropriate github teams](users.categories).

If you **are not** follow these steps:

- \[ \] Did you [sign up for LEAP membership](users.membership.apply)? This will be done for you if you sign up for an event like the Momentum bootcamp!
- \[ \] Did you receive a github invite? [Here](users.membership.invite) is how to check for that.
- \[ \] Check again if they are part of the [appropriate github teams](users.categories).
- If these steps do not work, please reach out to the [](support.data_compute_team).

If you **are** member of one of the github teams, ask them to try the following steps:

- \[ \] Refresh the browser cache
- \[ \] Try a different browser
- \[ \] Restart the computer
- If these steps do not work, please reach out to the [](support.data_compute_team).

## I received a warning about space on my User Directory

To accommodate an expanding LEAP community, the data and compute team has instituted a storage quota for all [User Directories](https://leap-stc.github.io/leap-pangeo/jupyterhub.html#your-user-directory). We hope a recommended limit of 25GB and hard limit of 50GB will help maintain the reliability of the hub for all users (recall that everyone is using the same underlying storage so if it fills up, the Hub crashes for everyone!). If you get a Hub Usage Alert email, this means you are going beyond the recommended limits. Users who persistently violate hub usage policies may temporarily get reduced access. Some ways to address this are:

- consider moving completed or old work to alternate storage locations such as Github.
- Deleting cached files and ipython checkpoints from old projects
- move large datasets into a [cloud bucket](https://leap-stc.github.io/leap-pangeo/jupyterhub.html#leap-pangeo-cloud-storage-buckets). Remember that user directories are for scripts and notebooks not datasets!

Our goal is to accomodate all users and thus we are happy to assist users in relocating data.  If you have any concerns, please reach out to the [](support.data_compute_team).
