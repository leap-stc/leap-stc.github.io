# Education Guide

This guide is intended for folks who want to run classes using the LEAP Pangeo resources.

## Teaching classes using the LEAP-Pangeo JupyterHub

### Can I use LEAP-Pangeo resources to teach my class?

LEAP provides infrastructure support to [officially affiliated courses](reference.education.leap_affiliated_course). If you are an instructor and want your class to become affiliated with LEAP, you should contact the [](support.data_compute_team) well in advance (ideally a month before the starting date of the class) in order to coordinate efforts efficiently.

### Preparing Classes

We suggest that instructors preprare their materials directly on the hub as much as possible, to ensure an identical experience for the students during the class. To develop/test/edit material instructors should apply for [](users.membership.apply) under the **education category** as soon as possible and make sure to check out our [](tutorial.getting_started) to familiarize yourself with the environment.

### Sign up students

All students should apply for [membership](users.membership.apply) under the **education category** well ahead of the starting date of the class (ideally a week before).

```{important}
A github account is required to gain access to LEAP-Pangeo. It is free to create.
```

Instructors can verify that students have access by checking that their github usernames as listed as members of [this github team](https://github.com/orgs/leap-stc/teams/leap-pangeo-base-access). We suggest that instructors direct students to [this documentation](https://leap-stc.github.io/intro.html) and ask them to test their [access to the Hub](hub:server:login) before the class starts to avoid any technical interruptions.

### Troubleshooting

#### Students cannot sign on

Please refer to the [FAQ](faq.cannot-log-into-hub) for troubleshooting steps.
