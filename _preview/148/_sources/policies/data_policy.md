# Data Policy

## Types of Data Used at LEAP

Within the LEAP project we distinguish between several different types of data mostly based on whether the data was used or produced at LEAP and if the data is already accessible in {abbr}`ARCO` formats in the cloud.

:::\{admonition} LEAP produced
:class: dropdown
Data that has been created or modified by LEAP researchers.
:::

:::\{admonition} LEAP ingested
:class: dropdown
Data that is already publically available but has been ingested into cloud storage in {abbr}`ARCO` formats. The actual data/metadata has not been modified from the original.
:::

:::\{admonition} LEAP curated
:class: dropdown
Data that is already available in  {abbr}`ARCO` formats in publically accessible object storage. Adding this data to the LEAP-Pangeo Catalog enables us to visualize it with the Data Viewer, and collect all datasets of importance in one single location, but none of the data itself is modified.
