### Administrator and Developer Category

The LEAP Manager of Data and Computing may grant access to other participants for
the purposes of technical development, debugging, and evaluation of the platform. These members will be added to the [`leap-pangeo-full-access`](https://github.com/orgs/leap-stc/teams/leap-pangeo-full-access) team to have full access to all resources.

## Github Teams and Resources

The access to the JupyterHub is implemented via [Github Teams](https://docs.github.com/en/organizations/organizing-members-into-teams/about-teams) in the [leap-stc](https://github.com/orgs/leap-stc/teams) GitHub organization. Each Membership tier maps to a single Github Team which determines the resources available to the user.

## Applying for membership

To become a LEAP member please use the [Application Form](https://forms.gle/RpeaMZh5btTdZtzu8).

Once you have applied for membership, it will take a few days until you can be approved. Please watch out for email from LEAP that contains instructions on how to proceed.

## Termination of Access

Users who violate usage policies will have their access suspended pending investigation.
The LEAP Director of Data and Computing decides if a policy has been violated and
may suspend or terminate access to LEAP-Pangeo at any time.

## Offboarding Process

Users may also be transferred from e.g. the Education Category to the Community Category
when their termed access ends.
Removing a user from the corresponding team is sufficient to disable their access
to those resources.
Removing a user from the `leap-pangeo-users` group entirely will disable their access
completely.
An automated process will delete user data from the hub one month after a user
is removed from the `leap-pangeo-users` group.
