# Getting Started

To get started using the hub, check out this video by [James Munroe](https://github.com/jmunroe) from [2i2c](https://2i2c.org) explaining the architecture.

## How can I get access to the Hub

Only LEAP members will be able to access the hub. Please [become a member](users.membership.apply) and make sure you accept the [invitation on github](users.membership.invite) before proceeding

## Hub Usage

This is a rough and ready guide to using the Hub.
This documentation will be expanded as we learn and evolve.
Feel free to [edit it yourself](https://github.com/leap-stc/leap-stc.github.io/blob/main/book/leap-pangeo/jupyterhub.md) if you have suggetions for improvement!

### Logging In

1. üëÄ Navigate to <https://leap.2i2c.cloud/> and click the big orange button that says "Log in to continue"
1. üîê You will be prompted to authorize a GitHub application. Say "yes" to everything.
   Note you must belong to the appropriate GitHub team in order to access the hub.
   See {doc}`/policies/users_roles`  for more information.
1. üì† You will redirect to a screen with the following options.

> Note: Depending on your [membership](users.membership) you might see additional options (e.g. for GPU machines)

You have to make 3 choices here:

- The machine type (Choose between "CPU only" or "GPU" if available)
  **‚ö†Ô∏èThe GPU images should be used only when needed to accelerate model training.**
- The software environment ("Image"). Find more info in the [Software Environment Section](hub:image) below.
- The node share. These are shared resources, and you should try to use the smallest image you need. You can easily start up a new server with a larger share if you find your work to be limited by CPU/RAM

4. üï• Wait for your server to start up. It can take up to few minutes.

#### GPUs

Tier2 and Tier3 members (see [Users and Categories](../../policies/users_roles.md)) have access to a 'Large' Server instance with GPU. Currently the GPUs are [Nvidia T4](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/tesla-t4/) models. To check what GPU is available on your server you can use [`nvidia-smi`](https://developer.nvidia.com/nvidia-system-management-interface) in the terminal window. You should get output similar to this:

```shell

   nvidia-smi
   
   +-----------------------------------------------------------------------------+
   | NVIDIA-SMI 510.47.03    Driver Version: 510.47.03    CUDA Version: 11.6     |

   |                               |                      |                  N/A |
   +-------------------------------+----------------------+----------------------+
```

### Using JupyterLab

After your server fires up, you will be dropped into a JupyterLab environment.

If you are new to JupyterLab, you might want to peruse the [user guide](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/user/interface.html).

### Shutting Down Your Server

Your server will shut down automatically after a period of inactivity.
However, if you know you are done working, it's best to shut it down directly.
To shut it down, go to <https://leap.2i2c.cloud/hub/home> and click the big red button that says "Stop My Server"

You can also navigate to this page from JupyterLab by clicking the `File` menu and going to `Hub Control Panel`.
