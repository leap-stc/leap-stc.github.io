# Users and Categories

**Version 2 - 2022-10-25**

Access to the LEAP-Pangeo Hub will depend on the [LEAP Membership Structure](https://leap.columbia.edu/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/LEAP-Membership-and-Space-Policy-Sept-2022.pdf) (see links in this document to apply for membership).
Membership in a particular tier will be implemented via
[GitHub Teams](https://docs.github.com/en/organizations/organizing-members-into-teams)
in the [leap-stc](https://github.com/orgs/leap-stc/teams) GitHub organization.

Here we define those roles and map them to GitHub teams.

:::{warning}
We have discovered a technical issue which affects some of the policies here.
It turns out that GitHub sub-teams don't appear as part of parent teams.
This means that the strategies described here for using sub-teams don't quite  work.
The issue is being tracked by 2i2c in <https://github.com/2i2c-org/infrastructure/issues/1311>.

The short term resolution is to _manually add users to both the parent team and sub-team_.
This is annoying, and we hope to have a better solution soon.

## Code of Conduct

All users of LEAP-Pangeo must abide by the LEAP Code of Conduct:

## Membership

LEAP members are grouped into the following member tiers.

### Tier 1 Members

Tier 1 members have access to [storage](hub.data.buckets) and computing resource up to 4 cores and 32GB RAM on JupyterHub servers
in the LEAP-Pangeo Hub.

Tier 1 membership is granted by adding the user to the [`leap-pangeo-base-access`](https://github.com/orgs/leap-stc/teams/leap-pangeo-base-access) GitHub Team.

### Tier 2 Members

Tier 2 members involved in LEAP research and community, have access to all computing resources and storage on LEAPangeo. In addition to the CPU computing resources, Tier 2 members get GPU access.

Tier 2 membership is granted by adding the user to the [`leap-pangeo-full-access`](https://github.com/orgs/leap-stc/teams/leap-pangeo-full-access) GitHub Team.

Tier 2 membership requires an application reviewed by LEAP’s Convergence Subcommittee. [Application Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSf_-vvkU__-rnaQimXRxAN_xGdQlqLulbBUistmetrhQtTjHg/viewform)

Tier 2 membership also provides swipe access at Innovation Hub (for Columbia affiliates). Members can apply to attend LEAP’s Annual Meeting and to be part of focus groups.

### Tier 3 Members

Tier 3 membership is reserved for individuals supported by LEAP funding as a Request for Proposal (RFP) PI, Co-PI, researcher, student, or postdoc.

Tier 3 members currently have identical access to LEAP pangeo computing resources and storage as Tier 2 members.

Tier 3 membership is granted by adding the user to the [`leap-pangeo-full-access`](https://github.com/orgs/leap-stc/teams/leap-pangeo-full-access) GitHub Team.

### Education Category

The education category is intended for _termed access_ to LEAP-Pangeo Hub resources associated
with educational activities. Examples of educational activities include:

- Semester-long LEAP-affiliated courses
- Short bootcamps and hackathons

Members of the Community Category may access to `Small`, `Medium`, and `Large` JupyterHub servers
in the LEAP-Pangeo Hub.

Membership in the Community Category is granted by adding the user to the
[`leap-pangeo-education`](https://github.com/orgs/leap-stc/teams/leap-pangeo-education)
GitHub Team.
Additional sub-teams will be created within this team to organize students into
specific courses, bootcamps, etc.

#### Eligibility

Course instructors who meet one of the following criteria are eligible to request
access for their class (including self, co-instructor(s), TAs, students, evaluators, etc):
- LEAP senior personnel or advanced research member
- Full-time faculty at LEAP Institution (Columbia, NYU, UMN, UCI)
- Full-time faculty who participated in a LEAP’s "train the trainer" workshop

#### Proposal Process

Course instructors may propose to the LEAP-Pangeo Hub for their upcoming course by submitting
a short proposal to the LEAP’s Convergence Subcommittee.
Instructors are required to submit their proposal at least 30 days before the participants will require.
The proposal should provide the following information.
- Instructor's GitHub username
- Basic information about the course (institution, department/program, student population, class size, course dates)
- Basic information about the Instructor (name, affiliation, research interests)
- Confirmation of available administrative support for using the LEAP-Pangeo Hub for the class (setting up user account, monitoring use, etc)
- Anticipated usage level of LEAP-Pangeo Hub, including
  - Number of user hours / week
  - Types of virtual machines to be used (`Small`, `Medium`, or `Large`)

</div>

Once the proposal is approved, a LEAP administrator will create a GitHub sub-team
within the [`leap-pangeo-education`](https://github.com/orgs/leap-stc/teams/leap-pangeo-education)
team for the course and add the instructor as a "Maintainer".
It is the instructor's responsibility to add the course's users to this team
and remove them when the course has been concluded.

### Research Category

The education category is intended for _long-term access_ to LEAP-Pangeo resources associated
with research activities.

There are two levels to the Research Category:
- **Entry-level**: involved in LEAP research and community, have access to computing resources and storage on LEAPangeo.
Members of this Community Tier may access  `Large` JupyterHub servers
Office Space. Admission based on paragraph sent to Office Space committee.
Membership in the entry-level research category corresponds to the
[`leap-pangeo-research-entry-level`](https://github.com/orgs/leap-stc/teams/leap-pangeo-research-entry-level)
GitHub team.
- **Advanced**: RFP or supported researcher, student, postdoc, invited to annual meeting, swipe access for LEAP.
Members of this Community Tier may access `Large` and `Huge` JupyterHub servers, plus GPU access.
Membership in the entry-level research category corresponds to the
[`leap-pangeo-research-advanced`](https://github.com/orgs/leap-stc/teams/leap-pangeo-research-entry-level)
GitHub team.

### Eligibility

Anyone participating in a LEAP-sponsored research project is eligible to participate
in the Research Category.
A LEAP administrator will create a GitHub sub-team within the
[`leap-pangeo-research`](https://github.com/orgs/leap-stc/teams/leap-pangeo-research)
team for each research project and add the project PIs as "maintainer".
It is the PIs' responsibility to add and remove members from their team.

### Administrator and Developer Category

The LEAP Director of Data and Computing or the LEAP Manager of Data and Computing may grant access to other participants for
the purposes of technical development, debugging, and evaluation of the platform. These members will be added to the [`leap-pangeo-full-access`](https://github.com/orgs/leap-stc/teams/leap-pangeo-full-access) team to have full access to all resources.

### Applying for membership

To become a LEAP member please refer to the [Research Membership Structure](https://leap.columbia.edu/about/policies2/) on the LEAP website.

### "Where is my invite?"

Please check your email account (**the one you used to sign up for Github** - this is independent of the email you use for LEAP) for an invite that will look similar to this:


<img src="../images/email_org_invite.png" alt="LEAPPangeo email invite" height="300"/>


Click the link and accept all invites.

Alternatively you can log into your github account, and should see a notification in the top right menu under the "Organizations" tab.

<img src="../images/gh_org_invite_1.png" alt="LEAPPangeo gh invite" height="300"/>

You can follow that and accept the invitation there aswell.

<img src="../images/gh_org_invite_2.png" alt="LEAPPangeo gh invite2" height="150"/>

### Termination of Access

Users who violate usage policies will have their access suspended pending investigation.
The LEAP Director of Data and Computing decides if a policy has been violated and
may suspend or terminate access to LEAP-Pangeo at any time.

### Offboarding Process

Users may also be transferred from e.g. the Education Category to the Community Category
when their termed access ends.
Removing a user from the corresponding team is sufficient to disable their access
to those resources.
Removing a user from the `leap-pangeo-users` group entirely will disable their access
completely.
An automated process will delete user data from the hub one month after a user
is removed from the `leap-pangeo-users` group.
