# Teaching Classes (Education)

This guide is intended for folks who want to run classes using the LEAP Pangeo resources.

## Teaching classes using the LEAP-Pangeo JupyterHub

### Can I use LEAP-Pangeo resources to teach my class?

LEAP provides infrastructure support to [](reference.education.leap_affiliated_course). If you are an instructor and want your class to become affiliated with LEAP, you should contact the [](support.data_compute_team) well in advance (ideally a month before the starting date of the class) in order to coordinate efforts efficiently.

### Preparing Classes

We suggest that instructors preprare their materials directly on the hub as much as possible, to ensure an identical experience for the students during the class. To develop/test/edit material instructors should apply for [membership](users.membership.apply) under the **education category** as soon as possible and make sure to check out our ['getting started' tutorial](tutorial.getting_started) to familiarize yourself with the environment.

### Team Membership

Contact a gitub organization admin to be added to the [education-instructors github team](https://github.com/orgs/leap-stc/teams/education-instructors) before the start of the classes. This will enable you to troubleshoot sign up issues (see below) by yourself.

### Sign up students

All students should apply for [membership](users.membership.apply) under the **education category** well ahead of the starting date of the class (ideally a week before).

```{important}
A github account is required to gain access to LEAP-Pangeo. It is free to create.
```

Instructors can verify that students have access by checking that their github usernames as listed as members of [this github team](https://github.com/orgs/leap-stc/teams/leap-pangeo-base-access). We suggest that instructors direct students to [this documentation](https://leap-stc.github.io/intro.html) and ask them to test their [access to the Hub](hub:server:login) before the class starts to avoid any technical interruptions.

Make sure to familiarize yourself with the troubleshooting steps below before the start of the class, so that you are prepared to sign up students on the first day if necessary.

### Troubleshooting

#### Students cannot sign on

Refer students to the [FAQ](faq.cannot-log-into-hub) for troubleshooting steps and follow the [admin troubleshooting steps](guide.team.admin.member_signup_troubleshooting) if problems persist.
