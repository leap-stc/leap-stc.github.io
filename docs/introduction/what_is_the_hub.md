# LEAP Jupyter Hub

LEAP's primary data and computational resources are available through the LEAP Jupyter Hub. The Jupyter Hub is a shared "cloud-based" computing environment running on cloud-based storage and compute resources.

The hub is designed primarily around **interactive** use, however long running jobs are also possible.

To gain access to the Hub please see the [Registration page][registration]. LEAP's Jupyterhub is managed by our partner [2i2c](https://2i2c.org).

The Hub includes

- **computing resources** accessible via a web browser or VSCode as described on [this page][accessing-the-hub]. The resources include a variety of hardware configurations and a range of pre-defined or custom software environments.

- **data resources** divided among generous shared "cloud buckets" for data and limited home directories for scripts etc. as described at [Where Data Lives][where-data-lives].

The computing resources have fast access to LEAP's data resources; they also have fast connections to the broader internet which lowers the barrier to working with data held elsewhere.

Compared to using:

- a **laptop**, the Hub offers fast access to data and the ability to access much more powerful computational resources including GPUs for ML training tasks.
- **HPCs, clusters, etc.** the hub offers simpler access and less competition for resources (since the pool from which the resources are drawn is enormous). It does not, however, easily support non-interactive use.

Moving data in to data resources is free; moving data out is expensive (see [Data Lifecycle][data-lifecycle]). Please plan your workflow accordingly.
