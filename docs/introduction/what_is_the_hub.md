## LEAP Jupyter-Hub

LEAP provides a JupyterHub (*The Hub*), which is a shared cloud-based compute environment. This platform gives LEAP researchers a quick and easy access path to working with cloud compute and data. Moving your processing scripts to the cloud allows you to access terrabytes of shared data and the ability to scale your compute well beyond your local laptop.
