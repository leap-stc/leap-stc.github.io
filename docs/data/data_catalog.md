# The LEAP data catalog 

LEAP maintains a catalog of publically-available datasets available via streaming at 
[https://catalog.leap.columbia.edu](https://catalog.leap.columbia.edu). 
The catalog includes data that's been ingested (link) from public sources as well as pointers to 
data sets maintained by others. The catalog can be viewed by anyone inside or outside of LEAP. 

Any data ingested with pangeo-forge or whatever we're calling it now is automatically dded to the catalog

Data in the catalog can be inspected with the data viewer? We should point to said viewer then. 

Q: Is some data in our GCS buckets? Then we should note that it's not readable from outside LEAP resources.
