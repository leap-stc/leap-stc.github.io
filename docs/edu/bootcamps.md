# Running Bootcamps

Bootcamp materials in the [LEAP-Pangeo bootcamp repository](https://github.com/leap-stc/LEAP-bootcamps). Please add the materials you develop for your bootcamp to this repo as described below.

## Preparing for the bootcamp

**Past attendees have suggested that it is very helpful to have the instructor write code from scratch.**
This ensures the following:

- The lecturer takes substantially more time to write live, ensuring that others can follow along.
- The lecturer is not a superhuman, but also makes mistakes and has to debug code. This is a very important lesson for students to learn, as it is a very common part of the coding process and often not shown in lectures.
- It also allows the lecturer to explain the code as they write it, which is a very important part of the learning process.

If it is necessary to use a notebook pre-populated with code, please clear all outputs prior to starting the lecture by following this procedure:

- In the Jupyter notebook, click on `Edit` in the top taskbar.
- Find and click `Clear Outputs of All Cells` from the dropdown menu.
- Save Jupyter notebook with cleared outputs by clicking `Save` from the top taskbar and then clicking `Save Notebook`.
- After the lecture is over, save the Jupyter notebook again to save the complete version with all outputs.

## Materials for the bootcamp

We encourage you to reuse materials from past bootcamps and adapt them to your needs. If you re-use material from previous bootcamps, please don't modify the original notebooks, instead create new copies for your use.

- Create a new folder in the "Codes" and "Lectures" folders and add your materials there. *If you are giving the same material as a previous bootcamp, please copy them.*
  !!! warning
  If you are using materials from other sources, like the [An Introduction to Earth and Environmental Data Science](https://earth-env-data-science.github.io/intro.html) book. Please just follow the past events structure and link to the original materials.

- [README.md](https://github.com/leap-stc/LEAP-bootcamps/README.md) Enter a new entry under the "Events" section. This should include an [nbgitpuller](https://nbgitpuller.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) link for each notebook you work with, so participants can easily pull the materials to their hub (there is a neat tool to [generate these links](https://nbgitpuller.readthedocs.io/en/latest/link.html)). Please also use the LEAP-Pangeo Hub badge by adding code like this:

  ```
  [![Open in LEAP-Pangeo Hub](https://custom-icon-badges.demolab.com/badge/Jupyter%20Hub-Launch%20%F0%9F%9A%80-blue?style=for-the-badge&logo=leap-globe)](<generated_link>) 
  ```

## Running the bootcamp

### Prepare ahead of the event

Bootcamp instructors should make sure that they are added to the [Bootcamp Instructors Github Team](https://github.com/orgs/leap-stc/teams/bootcamp-instructors) by contacting the [Data and Compute Team](../support/contact.md). This ensures that the people running the bootcamp can perform tasks that might be needed the day of (mostly often signing up folks who either entered wrong information or did not register ahead of time).

Before the event, we recommend that instructors follow these steps ahead of time:

- Before the bootcamp begins, double check that all participants github names are present in the [leap-pangeo-base-access](https://github.com/orgs/leap-stc/teams/leap-pangeo-base-access) team! If folks are in this team they will have access to the hub. If they are not present here, then we need to troubleshoot Hub access.
- The first thing to try is manually triggering the ["Parse Member Sheet and Add New Members" action](https://github.com/leap-stc/member_management/actions/workflows/read_sheet.yaml) by clicking on `Run Workflow > Run Workflow` in the top right menu. If a student has filled out the hub access sign-up form with the correct information, this action will invite them to the team and once they accept the invite, they will receive access to the Hub.
- If this does not work, it is likely that the student either (1 - Pending Invite) have not accepted the invite to the team yet or (2 - Wrong Username) made a mistake while inputting their Github username on the Hub access request form.
  - For (1 - Pending Invite), ask the student to accept the [leap-pangeo-base-access](https://github.com/orgs/leap-stc/teams/leap-pangeo-base-access) team invite on Github. More details on troubleshooting can be found [here](../../support/signup_troubleshooting).
  - For (2 - Wrong Username), check their github handles in the Member Data Google Sheet for typos.
- In either case, it is useful to have view/edit access to the Member Data Google Sheet. LEAPs Managing Director has the ability to add data or give others edit access â€“ request access via [Slack](https://leap-nsf-stc.slack.com/ssb/redirect) if you need it.

If you are anticipating many attendees to access the hub at the same time to follow along, it is useful to consult with the [Data & Compute Team](../../support/contact) beforehand to ensure a smooth presentation.

### Troubleshooting during the event

If students have trouble signing in to the hub, please refer to [Sign-up Troubleshooting](../../support/signup_troubleshooting) for troubleshooting steps.

## After the event

Please add your versions of the filled notebooks to a subfolder named `filled_notebooks` in the event folder you created above, so participants and future instructors can access them later.
