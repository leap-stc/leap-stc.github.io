# Teaching classes with LEAP infrastructure

LEAP provides infrastructure support to [LEAP-Affiliated Courses](https://leap.columbia.edu/education/education-curriculum/).

If you are an instructor of a LEAP-Affiliated Course and want your students to the LEAP Jupyter-hub, contact the [Data & Compute Team][contact] at least 3 weeks before the class start date in order to coordinate efforts for onboarding.

## Preparing to teach

### Class Material

We suggest that instructors and teaching assistants prepare class material directly on the hub as much as possible to ensure an identical experience for the students during the class.

To develop, edit, and test class material, we suggest that instructors themselves apply for [membership](https://forms.gle/RpeaMZh5btTdZtzu8) under the **education** category and check out our [Getting Started][getting-started] guide.

### Sign up students

All students should apply for [membership](https://forms.gle/RpeaMZh5btTdZtzu8) under the **education** category at least two weeks before the starting date of the class.

!!! note

    In order to gain access to the Jupyter-hub, a Github account is required. It is free to create one. Please instruct your students to create one before requesting access.

Instructors can verify that students have access by checking that their github usernames as listed as members of [leap-pangeo-base-access](https://github.com/orgs/leap-stc/teams/leap-pangeo-base-access) on Github. We suggest that instructors direct students to the [Getting Started][getting-started] page and ask them to test their [access to the Hub][accessing-the-hub] before the class starts to avoid any technical interruptions.

We recommend familiarizing yourself with the troubleshooting steps below before the start of the class, so that you are prepared to sign up students on the first day if necessary.

## Troubleshooting

### Students cannot access JupyterHub

Refer students to [sign-up troubleshooting][sign-up-troubleshooting] if problems persist. If this does not resolve the issue, please contact the [Data & Compute Team][contact].
