# Hub Access Error

## I cannot log into the hub ðŸ˜±

If you are unable to log into the hub, please check the following steps:

- [ ] Check if you are member of the [appropriate github teams](https://github.com/orgs/leap-stc/teams/).

If you **are not**, follow these steps:

- [ ] Did you [sign up for LEAP membership](https://forms.gle/RpeaMZh5btTdZtzu8)?
- [ ] Did you receive a github invite? See [Sign-up Troubleshooting](../signup_troubleshooting) for how to check for that.
- [ ] Check again if you are part of the [appropriate github teams](https://github.com/orgs/leap-stc/teams/) (most commonly `leap-pangeo-base-access`).

If you **are** a member of one of the github teams, try the following steps:

- [ ] Refresh the browser cache
- [ ] Try a different browser
- [ ] Restart your local machine
- [ ] Try [accessing the hub](../../compute/hub_access)

If these steps do not work, please reach out to the [Data and Compute Team](../support/contact.md).
