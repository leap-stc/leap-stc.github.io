# Contact the Data & Compute Team

The preferred way to contact the Data & Compute Team is via the Slack Workspace **LEAP-NSF-STC** (a.k.a. LEAP Slack)

## Ask a Question on the LEAP Slack Workspace

- Open the [LEAP Slack](https://leap-nsf-stc.slack.com/ssb/redirect) on any device
- Once you are in the workspace, add yourself to relevant channels listed below
- Search these two channels to see if anyone else had similar questions - chances are, the solution to your questions are already here!
- If issue persists after trying previous solutions, then let us know by posting a new thread and tagging us at `@data-and-compute`!
