# Contact

The preferred way to contact the Data & Compute Team is via the Slack Workspace **LEAP-NSF-STC**

## Ask a Question on the LEAP Slack Workspace

- Request access to the LEAP Slack by contacting LEAP: [leap@columbia.edu](mailto:leap@columbia.edu)
- Once you are given access, add yourself to relevant channels listed below within the workspace
- Search these two channels to see if anyone else had similar questions - chances are, the solution to your questions are already here!
- If issue persists after trying previous solutions, then let us know by posting a new thread and tagging us at `@data-and-compute`!
