## Where is my Jupyterhub invitation?

Please check your email account (**the one you used to sign up for Github** - this is independent of the email you use for LEAP) for an invite that will look similar to this:

Click the link and accept all invites.

Alternatively you can log into your github account, and should see a notification in the top right menu under the "Organizations" tab.

You can follow that and accept the invitation there as well.
