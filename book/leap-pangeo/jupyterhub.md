# LEAP-Pangeo JupyterHub

Our team has a cloud-based [JupyterHub](https://jupyter.org/hub).
For information who can access the hub with which privileges, please refer to
{doc}`/policies/users_roles`

| **Hub Address** | https://leap.2i2c.cloud/ |
| **Hub Location** | [Google Cloud `us-central1`](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/regions-zones) |

## Getting Started

To get started using the hub, check out this video by [James Munroe](https://github.com/jmunroe) from [2i2c](https://2i2c.org) explaining the architecture.

## Getting Help

For questions about how to use the Hub, please use the LEAP-Pangeo discussion forum:

- https://github.com/leap-stc/leap-stc.github.io/discussions

Someone respond to your post and decide whether to refer it to 2i2c for technical support.

## Hub Usage

This is a rough and ready guide to using the Hub.
This documentation will be expanded as we learn and evolve.
Feel free to [edit it yourself](https://github.com/leap-stc/leap-stc.github.io/blob/main/book/leap-pangeo/jupyterhub.md) if you have suggetions for improvement!

### Logging In

1. üëÄ Navigate to https://leap.2i2c.cloud/ and click the big orange button that says "Log in to continue"
2. üîê You will be prompted to authorize a GitHub application. Say "yes" to everything.
   Note you must belong to the appropriate GitHub team in order to access the hub.
   See {doc}`/policies/users_roles`  for more information.
3. üì† You will redirect to a screen with the following options. Choose which machine type you want to use.

   You should try to use the smallest image you need.
   The GPU images should be used only when needed to accelerate model training.
4. üï• Wait for your server to start up. It's normal for this to take a few minutes.

### Using JupyterLab

After your server fires up, you will be dropped into a JupyterLab environment.

If you are new to JupyterLab, you might want to peruse the [user guide](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/user/interface.html).

### Shutting Down Your Server

Your server will shut down automatically after a period of inactivity.
However, if you know you are done working, it's best to shut it down directly.
To shut it down, go to https://leap.2i2c.cloud/hub/home and click the big red button that says "Stop My Server"

You can also navigate to this page from JupyterLab by clicking the `File` menu and going to `Hub Control Panel`.

### The Python Environment

The Hub environment contains a full-featured, up-to-date Python environment.
The environments are maintained by Pangeo. You can read all about them at the following URL:

- https://github.com/pangeo-data/pangeo-docker-images/

These are Docker images which you can also run on your own computer.
The Hub contains a specific version of the image which can be found [here](https://github.com/2i2c-org/infrastructure/blob/master/config/clusters/leap/common.values.yaml).
For example, at the time of writing, the version of `pangeo-notebook` is `2022.05.10`.
A complete list of all packages installed in this environment is located at:

- https://github.com/pangeo-data/pangeo-docker-images/blob/2022.05.10/pangeo-notebook/packages.txt

There are separate images for pytorch and tensorflow.

You can install additional packages using `pip` and `conda`.
However, these will disappear when your server shuts down.

### Files and Data

Data and files work differently in the cloud.
To help onboard you to this new way of working, we have written a guide to Files and Data in the Cloud:

- https://docs.2i2c.org/en/latest/user/storage.html

We recommend you read this thoroughly, especially the part about Git and GitHub.

### Dask

To help you scale up calculations using a cluster, the Hub is configured with Dask Gateway.
For a quick guide on how to start a Dask Cluster, consult this page from the Pangeo docs:

- https://pangeo.io/cloud.html#dask

[More info to be added soon]

### GPUs

Tier2 and Tier3 members (see [Users and Categories](../../policies/users_roles.md)) have access to a 'Large' Server instance with GPU. Currently the GPUs are [Nvidia T4](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/tesla-t4/) models. To check what GPU is available on your server you can use [`nvidia-smi`](https://developer.nvidia.com/nvidia-system-management-interface) in the terminal window. You should get output similar to this:

```shell

   nvidia-smi
