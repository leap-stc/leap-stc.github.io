# Running LEAP bootcamps with LEAP-Pangeo

We collect all bootcamp materials in the [LEAP-Pangeo bootcamp repository](https://github.com/leap-stc/LEAP-bootcamps).

## Preparing for the bootcamp

You can reuse the materials for your own bootcamps or modify them to your needs. Please do not change the past materials, and instead create new folders/entries in the following places:
- Create a new folder in the "Codes" and "Lectures" folders and add your materials there. *If you are giving the same material as a previous bootcamp, please copy them.*
    - ⚠️If you are using materials from other sources, like the [An Introduction to Earth and Environmental Data Science](https://earth-env-data-science.github.io/intro.html) book. Please just follow the past events structure and link to the original materials. 
- [README.md](https://github.com/leap-stc/LEAP-bootcamps/README.md) Enter a new entry under the "Events" section. This should include an [nbgitpuller](https://nbgitpuller.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) link for each notebook you work with, so participants can easily pull the materials to their hub (there is a neat tool to [generate these links](https://nbgitpuller.readthedocs.io/en/latest/link.html)). Please also use the LEAP-Pangeo Hub badge by adding code like this: 
    ```
    [![Open in LEAP-Pangeo Hub](https://custom-icon-badges.demolab.com/badge/Jupyter%20Hub-Launch%20%F0%9F%9A%80-blue?style=for-the-badge&logo=leap-globe)](<generated link>) 
    ```
    > Add the generated link to the `<>` brackets.
## Running the bootcamp

If students have trouble signin into the hub, please refer to the [FAQ](faq.cannot-log-into-hub) for troubleshooting steps.

## Debrief

Please add your versions of the filled notebooks to a subfolder named `filled_notebooks` in the eventfolder you created above, so participants can access them later.
