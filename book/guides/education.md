### Prepare Classes

Instructors that plan to host a [](definitions.leap-affiliated-course) should contact the [](support.data_compute_team) well in advance (ideally a month before the starting date of the class) in order to coordinate efforts efficiently.

We suggest that instructors preprare their materials directly on the hub as much as possible, to ensure an identical experience for the students during the class. To develop/test/edit material instructors should apply for [](membership.sign_up) under the **education category** as soon as possible.

### How to sign up students

All students should apply for [](membership.sign_up) under the **education category** well ahead of the starting date of the class (ideally a week before).

> \[!IMPORTANT\]
> A github account is required to gain access to LEAP-Pangeo. It is free to create.

Instructors can verify that students have access by checking that their github usernames as listed as members of [this github team](https://github.com/orgs/leap-stc/teams/leap-pangeo-base-access). We suggest that instructors direct students to [this documentation](https://leap-stc.github.io/intro.html) and ask them to test their [access to the Hub](hub:server:login) before the class starts to avoid any technical interruptions.

#### Troubleshooting
