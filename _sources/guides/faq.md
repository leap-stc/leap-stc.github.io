(faq.where_is_my_invite)=

## "Where is my invite?"

Please check your email account (**the one you used to sign up for Github** - this is independent of the email you use for LEAP) for an invite that will look similar to this:

<img src="../images/email_org_invite.png" alt="LEAPPangeo email invite" height="300"/>

Click the link and accept all invites.

Alternatively you can log into your github account, and should see a notification in the top right menu under the "Organizations" tab.

<img src="../images/gh_org_invite_1.png" alt="LEAPPangeo gh invite" height="300"/>

You can follow that and accept the invitation there aswell.

(faq.cannot-log-into-hub)=

## I cannot log into the hub ðŸ˜±

If you are unable to log into the hub, please check the following steps:

- \[ \] Check if you are member of the [appropriate github teams](reference.membership.tiers).

If you **are not** follow these steps:

- \[ \] Did you [sign up for LEAP membership](users.membership.apply)? This will be done for you if you sign up for an event like the Momentum bootcamp!
- \[ \] Did you receive a github invite? [Here](faq.where_is_my_invite) is how to check for that.
- \[ \] Check again if they are part of the [appropriate github teams](reference.membership.tiers).
- If these steps do not work, please reach out to the [](support.data_compute_team).

If you **are** member of one of the github teams, ask them to try the following steps:

- \[ \] Refresh the browser cache
- \[ \] Try a different browser
- \[ \] Restart the computer
- If these steps do not work, please reach out to the [](support.data_compute_team).

(faq.usr_dir_usage_warning)=

## I received a warning about space on my User Directory

If you get a Hub Usage Alert email, this means you are violating the User Directory storage limit (to learn why this limit exists, see read about [User Directories](reference.infrastructure.hub.user_dir)). Remember that user directories are for scripts and notebooks not datasets! Users who persistently violate hub usage policies may temporarily get reduced cloud access.

**Troubleshooting**

- To see which files and directories are taking up the bulk of your storage, run  `du -h --max-depth=1 ~/ | sort -h`  in Terminal. It will likely reveal cached files and small/medium size data files that can be removed without disrupting typical usage.
- Delete cached files, ipython checkpoints, and any other unwanted files.
- If you still require more storage, it is likely that you are storing downloaded data in your user directory. We recommend storing data in a LEAP [cloud bucket](https://leap-stc.github.io/leap-pangeo/jupyterhub.html#leap-pangeo-cloud-storage-buckets) or data catalog. For more information, please consult our [](guide.data) and [](explanation.data-policy).

Our goal is to accomodate all community members and thus we are happy to assist users in relocating data.  If you have any concerns, please reach out to the [](support.data_compute_team).

## Dask "Killed Workers"

The "Killed Worker" message in dask can result due to a variety of reasons. Here are some of the common reasons why you might see such an error message

### Datasets Chunks too large

**Issue**
The default dask worker configuration can deal well with dataset chunk sizes of ~100MB. If the chunks of your data are significantly larger, your worker might crash just upon loading a few of these chunks into memory.

**Solution**
You can change the configuration of your dask workers and increase the memory each worker has to deal with larger chunks. You can adjust the memory by passing additional [options](https://gateway.dask.org/cluster-options.html) to the dask-gatway cluster upon creation:

```python
from dask_gateway import Gateway

gateway = Gateway()
options = gateway.cluster_options()

options.worker_memory = 10  # 10 GB of memory per worker.

# Create a cluster with those options
cluster = gateway.new_cluster(options)
cluster.scale(...)
client = cluster.get_client()
```

<!-- TODO: Add example how to change this in HTML repr -->
